Silicon Labs reduces cost and complexity of timing technology for coherent optical market,"April 25, 2016","
Silicon Labs introduced a family of jitter-attenuating clocks that simplifies 100G/400G coherent optical line card and module design by providing a high-frequency, flexible clocking solution that significantly reduces system-level cost and complexity. Silicon Labs’ new Si534xH coherent optical clocks replace discrete timing solutions that rely on expensive, large-footprint voltage-controlled SAW oscillators (VCSOs) to provide low-jitter reference timing for data converters. Unlike VCSOs that support single, fixed frequencies, the new Si534xH clocks operate over a wide frequency range, supporting frequencies up to 2.7 GHz without the need to change bill-of-material (BOM) components.",https://www.microwavejournal.com/articles/26340-silicon-labs-reduces-cost-and-complexity-of-timing-technology-for-coherent-optical-market
